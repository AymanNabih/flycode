# FlyCode
A new fruit fly-based algorithm implementation and comparison  with others codes already available.


This is how I configured the Fly-LSH code in order to compare that with the FlyCode I'll implement later on this repository

## Installation

I'm using Ubuntu 16.04 LTS with Python 2.7.12 already installed

    sudo apt install python-pip
